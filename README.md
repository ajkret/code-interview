# Job Interview



These days you need to have your skills and experience to stay in the Job.

Getting a new Job is another matter, you need to study and have experience on skills and fields that are
not that tied to the Position you are targeting.

I mean, going back to basics: Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Data Structures, etc.

Things from ***hackerrank***, ***L33t Code*** and ***algo.monster***



That is what I am trying to do here, learning and test.
